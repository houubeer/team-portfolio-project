## üîß Technical Challenges and Collaboration Insights

### Most Significant Technical Challenge

During the collaborative workflow, we found that when each team member worked on their own branch, no significant technical challenges were encountered. Individual development proceeded smoothly and independently.

### Merge Conflict Resolution

A specific merge conflict arose when two team members modified the same line in a file. This occurred because one of the edits was mistakenly applied. The conflict was resolved by:

1. Identifying the conflicting line during the merge process.
2. Discarding the incorrect change.
3. Keeping the correct version to ensure the final functionality remained accurate.

This procedural approach ensured that the merge was resolved cleanly without affecting other parts of the codebase.

### Pull Request and Peer Review Efficacy

The pull request and peer review process played a critical role in improving the quality of our project. Many small errors, such as incorrect paths or minor details affecting navigation to the main page, were only discovered during code review. Peer review allowed us to catch these issues early, maintain consistency, and enhance the overall robustness of the software artifact.
